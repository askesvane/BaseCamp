    "Loops are another form of control flow. Loops do something repeatedly. In python you can loop through anything that is *iterable*, e.g. anything where it makes sense to say \"for each element in this item, do whatever.\" Lists, tuples and dictionaries are all iterable, and can thus be looped over. This kind of loop is called a *for loop*. The basic syntax is: \n",

    "```python\n",
    "for element in SomeIterable:\n",
    "    dosomething(element)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `element` is a temporary name given to the current element reached in the loop, and `dosomething()` can be any valid python code. \n",

One specific application where a while loop can be useful is data collection on the internet (scraping) which is often open ended.
