    "## 1. Conditional Flow Control (aka If Statements)\n",
    "\n",
    "If statements are a form of flow control. _Flow control_ means writing code that controls the way data or information flows through the program. These are fundamental structures to programming. Recall that they also have a long history in how programming languages have been designed. \n",
    "The concepts of flow control should be recognizable outside of coding as well. For example when you go shopping you might want to buy ice cream, but only **if** it's sunny and warm outside. **else** you will buy hot chocolate. These kinds of logic come up everywhere in coding; self driving cars should go forward only **if** the light is green, items should be listed for sale in a web shop only **if** they are in stock. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in Python the conditional flow control can use three conditional statements: `if`, `elif` (else if) and `else`. The `if` and `elif` statements should be followed by a logical statement or condition that is either `True` or `False`. The code that should be executed `if` the logic is `True` is written on the lines below the `if`, and should be indented one TAB (or 4 spaces). Finally all flow control statements must end with a colon. \n",

    "## 5. Tracing and Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "While you are getting steadly more at ease with working in Python, error messages will remain a constant companion. Therefore, dealing with error messages and resolving them is a key part of writing and working with code. While you will gain most of the knowledge and facility of how to do this tracing and debugging while practicing coding yourself, there are some best practices that can help you develop this facility. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Treat error messages like guide posts not stop signs–they are intended to help you solve an error not discourage you from coding.\n",
    "2. Read the guide posts carefully, starting from the last line describing the error, then looking at the last marker–`^` or `---->`–to identify the location of the error.\n",
    "3. Remember and make use of the layers of support in this class and the overall programming community: \n",
    "    1. Consult your readings, earlier notebooks, own comments, and [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)\n",
    "    2. Look up error messages in only forums (such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) and the internet more broadly)\n",
    "    3. Involve your Base Camp group\n",
    "    4. Draw on the TAs during exercise sessions\n",
    "    5. Pose the problem to instructors on the [Absalon Discussion Forum](https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/45629/discussion_topics/282640)\n",
    "4. Sometimes running a section of code with an error will get stuck in the memory (cache) of your Python session. If you are confident that you have resolved the error in your code but it persists, try restarting your session by clicking 'Kernel' > 'Restart'. _Note:_ This will also clear everything you did in earlier cells from the memory (cache).\n",
    "5. Other times the errors will cause a process to run endlessly without actually raising an error. You can determine this by looking at the dot on the top right corner, if it is solid Python is busy, if it is hollow Python is idle. If Python is busy for an unreasonably long amount of time, you can interrupt the process by clicking 'Kernel' > 'Interrupt'. _Note:_ This will also likely require you to run everything you did so far over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Task 5.1:** Look at the three cells and their error messages below. For each, \n",
    "    > - write out the error message\n",
    "    > - identify the location of the error\n",
    "    > - revise the code _in any way that resolves the error_ and rerun the cell\n",
    "    > - write a one to three sentence reflection on how you approached and resolved the error"
