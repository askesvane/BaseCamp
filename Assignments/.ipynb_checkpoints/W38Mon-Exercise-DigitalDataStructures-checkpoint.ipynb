    "<p>Mortimer \"Morty\" Smith is one of the title characters and the secondary protagonist of the American animated television series Rick and Morty. Created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, Morty is an anxious 14-year-old based on Michael J. Fox's Marty McFly from Back to the Future.[3] Known for his awkward, anxious, second-guessing, and doubtful personality and low sense of self-esteem, the character has been well-received. He is the good-natured and impressionable grandson of alcoholic mad scientist Rick Sanchez, the son of Jerry and Beth Smith, and the younger brother of Summer Smith, who can be easily manipulated.</p>\n",
